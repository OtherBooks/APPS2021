  <p>
    A <term>conditional</term> is a statement of the form
    <q>if <m>A</m> then <m>B</m>,</q>
    or
    <q><m>A</m> only if <m>B</m>,</q>
    or
    <q><m>A</m> implies <m>B</m>.</q>
    We write this symbolically as
    <me>
      A \implies B
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This statement says that whenever <m>A</m> is true,
    we can conclude <m>B</m> is true.
    Statement <m>A</m> is called the
    <term>premise</term> of the conditional,
    and <m>B</m> is its <term>conclusion</term>.
    We can also write this backwards as <m>B \Longleftarrow A</m>,
    which is read
    <q><m>B</m> if <m>A</m>.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the truth table for the conditional

    Notice that if the statement <m>B</m> is true,
    then the statement <m>A \implies B</m> is true.
    If <m>A</m> is false,
    then the statement <m>A \implies B</m> is again true.
    The only way <m>A \implies B</m> ends up false is when <m>A</m> is true but <m>B</m> isn't.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The statement
        <q>If <m>2</m> is even, then <m>14</m> is even</q>
        is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The statement
        <q>If <m>2</m> is even, then <m>15</m> is even</q>
        is false.
      </p>
      <p>
        The statement
        <q>If <m>57</m> is prime, then <m>937</m> is prime</q>
        is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        The statement
        <q>If <m>57</m> is prime, then <m>2</m> is odd</q>
        is true.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    This sometimes surprises people a little, because in English
    (and in other natural languages),
    we are a little more casual in our use of the words
    <q>if <m>A</m>, then <m>B</m>.</q>
    In mathematics, the statement
    <m>A \implies B</m> can be re-expressed as the following:
    <me>
      \text{ ``either \(B\) is true or \(A\) is false.'' }
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, <m>A \implies B</m> has exactly the same truth table as <m>\overline{A} \vee B</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To prove a conditional statement <m>A\Longrightarrow B</m>
    <term>directly</term>, you proceed as follows:
    <ol label="labelalph">
      <li>
        <p>
          Start your proof by <term>assuming</term> the premise <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then deduce the conclusion <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the following statement
        <me>
          \text{ ``If \(n\) is an odd integer, then \(n^2\) is odd.'' }
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The premise in this example is
        <q><m>n</m> is an odd integer</q>
        and the conclusion is
        <q><m>n^2</m> is odd.</q>
        So to prove it,
        we need to assume the premise and then deduce the conclusion.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume <m>n</m> is an odd number.
        By definition this means <m>n=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          n^2=(2k+1)^2=4k^2+4k+1=2(2k^2+2k)+1
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently <m>n^2</m> is odd.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A\implies B</m> and <m>B\implies C</m>, then <m>A\implies C</m>.
        In other words,
        <m>((A \implies B) \wedge (B \implies C)) \implies (A \implies C)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The premise is <m>(A\implies B)\wedge(B\implies C)</m>.
        The conclusion is <m>A\implies C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume <m>(A\implies B)\wedge(B\implies C)</m>.
        That is, both <m>A \implies B</m> and <m>B \implies C</m> are true.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must deduce that <m>A\implies C</m>.
        To do this, assume <m>A</m> is true.
        We aim to show that <m>C</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>A</m> is true, and since <m>A\implies B</m>,
        we conclude <m>B</m> is true.
        Since <m>B</m> is true, and since <m>B\implies C</m>,
        we conclude <m>C</m> is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have now shown that if <m>A</m> is true,
        then <m>C</m> is true, thus <m>A\implies C</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

        The <term>converse</term> to the conditional
        <m>A \implies B</m> is the statement <m>B \implies A</m>.

    Note that the converse of a conditional is

    The conditional
    <q>if <m>2</m> is odd, then <m>937</m> is prime</q>
    is true
    (if a little strange).
    The converse
    <q>if <m>937</m> is prime, then <m>2</m> is odd</q>
    is false!

        The <term>contrapositive</term> of a conditional

    The contrapositive really is just a repackaging of the original conditional.
