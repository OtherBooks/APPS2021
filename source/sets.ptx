  <title>Sets</title>
  <p>
    A set <m>S</m> is a collection of objects,
    which we call the <term>elements</term> of <m>S</m>.
    Those elements can be anything:
    numbers, letters, animals, other sets.
    For example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3, \dots\}</m> is the set of strictly positive integers,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0,1,2, \dots\}</m> is the set of nonnegative integers,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots -3, -2, -1, 0,1,2,3, \dots\}</m> is the set of all integers,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbb{Q}</m> is the set of rational numbers
          (numbers that can be expressed as <m>\frac{m}{n}</m> for
          <m>m \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>),
          and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbb{R}</m> is the set of all real numbers.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For the moment,
    we're assuming that you have some familiarity with these sets:
    they will help us build examples to illustrate the different logical concepts that appear below.
    Later on we'll study each of these sets of numbers in much more detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    One way of writing down a set is to list them between curly brackets.
    So the set whose elements are <m>1,2,3</m> is written as
    <me>
      S=\{1,2,3\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two sets are <term>equal</term> if and only if they have the same elements.
    That means, for instance,
    that <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> is the <term>same set</term> as <m>\{3,1,2\}</m>.
    Consequently, when you're writing down a set,
    the order in which you list the elements is unimportant.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a matter of notation,
    if <m>a</m> is an element of the set <m>S</m>, we write <m>a\in S</m>.
    We write <m>a\not\in S</m> if <m>a</m> is not an element of the set <m>S</m>.
    For example,
    <m>1\in \{1,2,3\}</m> but <m>4\not\in \{1,2,3\}</m>.
    Similarly, <m>\text{ Clark } \notin \{1,2,3\}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sets can contain anything, even other sets.
    For example,
    <m>S=\{1,\{2\}\}</m> is the set consisting of the number <m>1</m> and also the set <m>\{2\}</m>.
    Thus <m>1\in S</m>, and <m>\{2\}\in S</m>, but <m>2\notin S</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two sets.
        We say that <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of <m>B</m>,
        or that <m>A</m> is <term>contained</term>
        in <m>B</m> if and only if each <m>x\in A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.
        We write <m>A \subseteq B</m> to say that
        <q><m>A</m> is a subset of <m>B</m>.</q>
        If there is an element of <m>A</m> not in <m>B</m>,
        we write <m>A\not\subseteq B</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's write down all the subsets of the set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>.
        In all there are <m>8</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> itself.
        Then there are the subsets with <m>2</m> elements:
        these are <m>\{1,2\}</m>, <m>\{1,3\}</m>,
        and <m>\{2,3\}</m>. (Note that <m>\{2,1\}</m> is a set that is already on our list!) Then there are the subsets with <m>1</m> element (sometimes called <term>singletons</term>):
        these are <m>\{1\}</m>, <m>\{2\}</m>, and <m>\{3\}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is one more subset of <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>.
        This is the set with <m>0</m> elements.
        This is called the <term>empty set</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>empty set</term>,
        written <m>\varnothing</m>, is the set that has no elements.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall that two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equal if they have the same elements.
        In other words, <m>A=B</m> if and only if both
        <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    If <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \not\subseteq A</m>,
    then we say that <m>A</m> is <term>properly contained</term> in <m>B</m>.
    Some people write <m>A \subset B</m> or even <m>A \subsetneqq B</m> to emphasize this.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We have <m>\mathbb{N}\subseteq \mathbb{Q}</m> since each integer is also a rational number,
        but <m>\mathbb{Q}\not\subseteq \mathbb{N}</m> since
        <m>\frac{1}{2}\in \mathbb{Q}</m> but <m>\frac{1}{2}\not\in \mathbb{N}</m>.
        Thus <m>\mathbb{N}</m> is properly contained in <m>\mathbb{Q}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, we have
        <me>
          \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N}_0 \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}
        </me>,
        and all these containments are proper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, <m>\{1,2\}\subseteq \{1,2,3\}</m> since
        <m>1\in \{1,2,3\}</m> and <m>2\in \{1,2,3\}</m>.
        However, <m>\{1,2,3\}\not\subseteq \{1,2\}</m> since
        <m>3\in \{1,2,3\}</m> but <m>3\not\in \{1,2\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
