  <title>The axioms for order</title>
  <p>
    An inequality is a relation on pairs of real numbers.
    We use the symbols <m>\leq,\geq,\lt ,></m> to denote these relationships.
    E.g.<nbsp/>we write <m>x \lt y</m>, spoken as
    <q><m>x</m> is less than <m>y</m>.</q>
    The informal idea is that <m>x\lt y</m> exactly when
    <q><m>x</m> is strictly to the left of <m>y</m> on the number line.</q>
    <m>x \lt y</m> means exactly the same thing as <m>y > x</m>
    (spoken as
    <q><m>y</m> is greater than <m>x</m></q>).
    When we write <m>x \leq y</m> we mean that either <m>x \lt y</m> or <m>x=y</m>.
    Hence it is true that <m>2 \leq 3</m>.
    We prefer to list the formal properties that <m>\lt</m> possesses which,
    together with the rules of addition and rules of multiplication from Section 2, make
    <m>\mathbb{R}</m> into what is called an
    <term>ordered field</term>.
    These properties of the relation <m>\lt</m> on the real numbers should be very familiar!
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An <term>ordered field</term> is a field <m>F</m>,
        together with a relation <m>\lt</m>,
        so that the following hold:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>(R1)</title>
            <p>
              (Positive/negative) If <m>x\in F</m>,
              then exactly one of the following is true:
              <m>0\lt x</m>, <m>x=0</m>, or <m>x\lt 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(R2)</title>
            <p>
              (Negations reverse) If <m>y\lt x</m>, then <m>-x\lt -y</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(R3)</title>
            <p>
              (Can add constants) If <m>x\lt y</m>,
              and <m>c\in F</m>, then <m>x+c\lt y+c</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(R4)</title>
            <p>
              (Positives multiply) If <m>0\lt x</m> and <m>0\lt y</m> then <m>0\lt xy</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>(R5)</title>
            <p>
              (Transitive property) If <m>x\lt y</m> and <m>y\lt z</m> then <m>x\lt z</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This definition gives a minimal set of
    <term>axioms</term>, that is,
    rules that we will take for granted,
    which are minimal in the sense that no axiom can be deduced from the others.
    Just like we demonstrated last week with the axioms of addition and multiplication,
    in this section we'll show how many standard facts about inequalities that we are used to can be deduced from these axioms.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can now define <m>x>y</m> if and only if <m>y\lt x</m>.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>x>0</m>, then <m>-x\lt 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      This follows immediately from (R2) with <m>0</m> in place of <m>y</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>x\neq 0</m>, then <m>x^2>0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>x>0</m> this follows from (R4).
      If <m>x\lt 0</m> then <m>-x>0</m>, so
      <me>
        0\lt (-x)^2= (-1)^2x^2=x^2
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Recall from Exercise 2.1 that <m>(-1)^2=1</m>.)
    </p>
  </proof>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that <m>1>0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This follows from the last proposition with <m>x=1</m>,
        since <m>0\lt 1^2=1\cdot 1=1</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    Pause for thought:
    why are we wasting our time proving things like <m>1 > 0</m>,
    which we have all known and understood since the early years of primary school?
    Mathematics is not just to establish what is true and what is false,
    but also to understand, in a critical way,
    the relationships between statements.
    What we learn from this exercise is that the statement <m>1 > 0</m> can be logically derived from the basic axioms (A0-A4), (M0-M5) and (R1-R5).
    The same applies to most other true statements of elementary arithmetic.

  <proposition xml:id="p_1_x_0">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>x>0</m>, then <m>\frac{1}{x}>0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>\frac{1}{x}\leq 0</m>.
      Then <m>-\frac{1}{x}\geq 0</m>, and so (R4) implies
      <me>
        0\leq -\frac{1}{x}\cdot x = -1 \lt  0
      </me>,
      which is a contradiction, thus <m>\frac{1}{x}> 0</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition xml:id="p_xu_xv">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>x>0</m>, then <m>u>v</m> if and only if <m>xu>xv</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      First assume <m>u>v</m>.
      If <m>x>0</m>, then
      <md>
        <mrow>u>v \amp  \stackrel{[R3]}{\Longrightarrow} u-v>v-v=0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp   \stackrel{[R4]}{\Longrightarrow} (u-v)x>0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \Longrightarrow ux-vx>0</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp  \stackrel{[R3]}{\Longrightarrow} ux>vx</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume <m>xu>xv</m>.
      Then we can use the same proof as above,
      but replacing <m>u</m> with <m>ux</m>,
      <m>v</m> with <m>vx</m>, and <m>x</m> with <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>
      (since <m>\frac{1}{x}>0</m> by <xref ref="p_1_x_0">Proposition</xref>).
    </p>
  </proof>
  <proposition xml:id="p_u_2_v_2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>0\lt u,v</m>, then <m>u^2>v^2</m> if and only if <m>u>v</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      First, notice that if <m>0\lt v,u</m>, then
      <me>
        u^2>v^2 \;\;\;   \stackrel{[R3]}{ \Longleftrightarrow} \;\;\;  u^2-v^2>v^2-v^2=0 \;\;\;  \Longleftrightarrow \;\;\;  (u-v)(u+v)>0
      </me>
      and by (R4), this last inequality is true if and only if <m>u-v>0</m>
      (since <m>u+v>0</m> by assumption),
      which by (R3) is true if and only if <m>0+v\lt u-v+v</m>,
      that is, if and only if <m>v\lt u</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
