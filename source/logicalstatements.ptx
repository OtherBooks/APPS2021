  <p>
    By a <term>statement</term>,
    we mean a sentence that asserts that something is the case.
    Here are some statements:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q><m>2</m> is even.</q>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q><m>937</m> is prime.</q>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q><m>57</m> is prime.</q>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>The only subset of <m>\varnothing</m> is <m>\varnothing</m> itself.</q>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <q>There are two points on opposite sides of the equator of the Earth where the temperatures are identical.</q>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Sentences like
    <q>go to bed</q>
    or
    <q>why so serious?</q>
    are not statements,
    because they don't assert that something is the case.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every statement is either True or False.
    That is, to any statement <m>A</m>,
    there is one and only one corresponding element of the set <m>\{True, False\}</m>.
    This is called the <term>truth-value</term> of <m>A</m>.
    Thus the truth value of
    <q><m>2</m> is even</q>
    is True; the truth-value of
    <q><m>937</m> is prime</q>
    is True; the truth-value of
    <q><m>57</m> is prime</q>
    is False; and the truth-value of
    <q>the only subset of <m>\varnothing</m> is <m>\varnothing</m> itself</q>
    is True.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's emphasize that there are plenty of statements whose truth-value is unknown to us.
    That is, we just don't know whether they are true or false.
    For instance,
    <q>Every even integer greater than <m>2</m> can be written as the sum of exactly two primes</q>
    is a statement,
    but we don't know whether this sentence is True or False.
    (This particular statement is known as the
    <term>Goldbach Conjecture</term>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Statements that include a <term>free variable</term>
    are useful in describing subsets of existing sets.
    For example,
    let's say we write down the set of integer multiples of <m>5</m>.
    If <m>n</m> is an integer, then we can consider the statement
    <me>
      A(n) = \text{ ``\(n\) is divisible by \(5\)'' }
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now what we want to do is to look at the set of integers <m>n</m> such that <m>A(n)</m> holds.
    This is a subset of the set <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> of integers;
    here's how we write it:
    <me>
      S = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} : A(n)\} = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} : n \text{ is divisible by 5 } \} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This reads
    <q><m>S</m> is the set of integers <m>n</m> such that <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>.</q>
    This is called <term>set-builder notation</term>.
    The colon <m>:</m> reads as
    <q>such that</q>; some authors use a vertical bar <m>|</m> for this,
    so that the sentence above could be rewritten
    <me>
      S=\{n\; |\; n \text{ is divisible by 5 } \}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Informally, <m>S</m> is the set
    <me>
      \{ \dots, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, \dots \}
    </me>,
    but the set-builder notation above is generally preferable to this informal description,
    because it isn't always clear what the pattern is.
    For example: if we write
    <me>
      \{3, 5, 7, \dots \}
    </me>,
    is that the set of odd numbers greater than <m>1</m>,
    or the set of odd prime numbers?
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>x</m> is a real number,
        then let <m>A(x)</m> be the statement
        <q><m>x\geq 0</m>.</q>
        Now we can look at the subset
        <me>
          \{x \in \mathbb{R} : A(x)\} = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \geq 0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the set of nonnegative real numbers.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sets
        <me>
          A=\{x\in\mathbb{R} : x^2= 1\}  \text{ and }   B=\{-1,1\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are two subsets of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
        In fact, we claim <m>A=B</m>.
        To prove this, we will first prove that
        <m>A \subseteq B</m> and then that <m>B \subseteq A</m>:
        <ol label="labelalph">
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x\in A</m>, then <m>x^2=1</m>,
              so <m>0=1-x^2=(1-x)(1+x)</m>.
              The only way the product of two numbers is zero is if at least one of them is zero,
              so <m>1-x=0</m> or <m>1+x=0</m>, i.e.
              <m>x=1</m> or <m>x=-1</m>, hence <m>x\in B</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>x\in B</m>, then <m>x=1</m> or <m>x=-1</m>,
              and in either case <m>x^2=1</m>, so <m>x\in A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S=\{x\in\mathbb{R} : x^2=-1\}</m>.
        The sentence
        <q><m>x^2=-1</m> has no solutions in <m>\mathbb{R}</m></q>
        is the natural language translation of the sentence
        <q><m>S=\varnothing</m>.</q>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    <em>Warning.</em> In order for set-builder notation <m>\{x \in S : A(x)\}</m> to be meaningful,
    it has to be the case that the statement <m>A(x)</m> makes sense for all elements <m>x \in S</m>.
    For example, if <m>S</m> is the set of all trees, then the set
    <me>
      \{ x \in S : x^2 = 1\}
    </me>
    doesn't make any sense,
    because we don't know how to take the square of a tree,
    or what it means for such a square to be equal to <m>1</m>.
    That may seem like a silly point,
    but this basic error leads to lots of mistakes!
