  <title>Decimals and Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We are all familiar with decimal representation of numbers.
      For example,
      given a rational number <m>x = \frac{p}{q}</m> with
      <m>p,
      q \in \mathbb{N}</m> and <m>0 \lt  p \lt  q</m>,
      we can go through the process of dividing <m>q</m> into <m>p</m> to represent it as
      <me>
        x = 0.a_1 a_2 \dots a_n \dots
      </me>
      where each <m>a_n</m> is an integer in the set <m>\{0,1,\dots, 9\}</m>.
      So we are used to writing
      <me>
        \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 = 0.50000\dots \mbox{ and }  \frac{2}{3} = 0.66666\dots
      </me>
      and we are also familiar with such expressions as
      <me>
        \sqrt{2} = 1.414\dots \mbox{ and }  \pi = 3.14159 \dots
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also more random looking examples such as
      <m>0.7264082793684301..</m>. which have no discernible pattern nor immediate purpose in life.
      But what exactly do we mean by these expansions?
      In this chapter we explore this question,
      and give a precise meaning to decimal expansions.
      We will show that <term>every</term>
      real number has a decimal expansion, and conversely,
      every decimal expansion gives rise to a real number.
      Thus, in some sense,
      decimal expansions provide a complete description of the real numbers.
      In order to do this,
      we use the study of sequences which we have already begun, and,
      in particular,
      we will make crucial use of the Completeness Axiom for <m>\mathbb{R}</m>
      (as indeed we must).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we will introduce infinite series and relate them to decimal expansions.
      You are probably familiar with certain infinite series already,
      such as the infinite geometric series
      <me>
        \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} = 1
      </me>,
      but we will examine series such as these from a more general perspective.
      Now is a good time to recall the formula for a finite geometric series:
      <me>
        a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \frac{a(1-r^{n})}{1-r}
      </me>
      whenever <m>r \neq 1</m>.
      You will learn more about infinite series if you are taking the course Calculus and its Applications.
      Finally, we introduce the number <m>e</m> and study some of its basic properties.
