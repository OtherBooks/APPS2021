  <title>Integers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This week we will study the integers,
      particularly the techniques of studying divisibility,
      the highest common factor, and prime factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These techniques are especially useful for solving
      <term>diophantine equations</term>,
      which are polynomial equations where we seek
      <term>integer</term> solutions.
      The most famous diophantine equation is
      <me>
        x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was famously claimed by Fermat
      (without proof)
      that there are solutions <m>x,y,z,n\in\mathbb{N}</m> only if <m>n=1</m> or <m>n=2</m>.
      It wasn't until 1994 when Andrew Wiles actually gave a proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week's set of tools are also useful when we are trying to show at a diophantine
      <term>can't</term> be solved.
      You have seen one such proof before:
      that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.
      Let's recall the proof briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose there was a rational number <m>\frac{m}{n}</m>
      (where <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are reduced in the sense that they have no common divisors apart from <m>1</m>)
      so that <m>\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^2=2</m>, then <m>m^2=2n^2</m>.
      This means that <m>m^2</m> is even.
      Then <m>m</m> must be even since,
      if instead <m>m=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>,
      then <m>m^2=(2k+1)^2=4(k^2+k)+1</m>,
      which is odd, a contradiction.
      Hence, <m>m=2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>, and so
      <me>
        2n^2=m^2=(2k)^2=4k^2
      </me>
      and so <m>n^2=2k^2</m>, and using a similar reasoning,
      we get that <m>n</m> must also be even,
      which is a contradiction since we assumed <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> had no common factors,
      but now we have shown they are both divisible by <m>2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important feature of the proof was to use the <term>coprimality</term>
      of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, that is,
      that they share no common divisors,
      as well as the fact that if <m>m^2</m> is divisible by <m>2</m>
      (that is, if <m>m^2</m> was even, then so was <m>m</m>).
      If we want to generalize this proof,
      we will need to develop these tools about divisibility and coprimality.
      Later, we will in fact show that
      <m>\sqrt{n}</m> is rational exactly when <m>n=m^2</m> for some integer <m>m</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As motivation for the techniques we develop along the way,
      we will show how they can be used to solve various diophantine equations.
      As a special final application of these techniques,
      we'll also classify all <term>Pythagorean Triples</term>,
      that is, integers <m>x,y,z</m> so that
      <me>
        x^2+y^2=z^2
      </me>.
