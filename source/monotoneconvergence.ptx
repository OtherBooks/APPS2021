  <title>The Monotone Convergence Theorem</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Last week we studied how to formally show that a sequence <m>(x_{n})</m> converges to a specific limit <m>L</m>,
      and we developed various rules for manipulating limits.
      What if we are given a sequence <m>(x_{n})</m> and want to show it converges but we
      <term>don't</term> know what the limit is?
    </p>
    <p>
      This week we will talk about an important convergence theorem which gives us a sufficient condition for a sequence to converge.
      This is the monotone convergence theorem,
      which says that any increasing sequence which is bounded above must converge to something.
      We'll then give some examples illustrating how this result can be useful.
      Then we will see how this result can shed light on something we are already familiar with <mdash/> decimal expansions <mdash/> and lastly we'll introduce the notion of infinite series.
