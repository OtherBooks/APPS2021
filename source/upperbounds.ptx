  <title>Upper Bounds and Least Upper Bounds</title>

      For the next two weeks,
      we'll learn about the basics of <term>analysis</term>.
      This branch of mathematics studies limits and approximations,
      and you may have already met these when studying calculus.
      If you end up enjoying this topic,

      <em>Why care?</em> Firstly,
      a lot of what we now call analysis was not very rigorous prior to the 1800s.
      The mathematician Niels Abel went so far as to say the following about the state of analysis at the time:
    </p>
    <p>
      <term> I shall devote all my efforts to bring light into the immense obscurity that today reigns in Analysis.
      It so lacks any plan or system,
      that one is really astonished that so many people devote themselves to it <mdash/> and,
      still worse, it is absolutely devoid of any rigour.</term><fn>

      </fn>
    </p>
    <p>
      To give an idea about what he was talking about, Leibniz
      (that is, together with Newton,
      one of the founders of modern calculus)
      believed at one time that
      <me>
        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n} = \frac{1}{2}
      </me>,
      but with modern rigour we now understand that this is sadly not true.
      In fact, this sum is meaningless, as we shall see later.
      Making analysis rigorous was a big problem since it is the foundation of calculus:
      many of the computations you perform in calculus,
      such as taking derivatives and evaluating integrals,
      in fact rely on analysis under the bonnet.
      More shockingly,
      we need tools from analysis even to just take <m>n</m>'th roots,
      as we shall see later as well.
      Before getting into limits,
      however, we will need to discuss upper and lower bounds for sets,
      and to introduce a final axiom for the real numbers.
