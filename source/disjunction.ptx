    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>disjunction</term> of two statements <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is the statement <m>A\text{ or } B</m>.
        This is also sometimes written as <m>A \vee B</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth-value of the disjunction operates like this:
        <me>
          A \vee B \text{ is true exactly when either } A\text{ is true or } B\text{ is true }
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Here is the truth table for the disjunction:

    <row>
      <cell><m>A</m></cell>
      <cell><m>B</m></cell>
      <cell><m>A \vee B</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell></cell>

      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
    Note that
    <q>or</q>
    in this sense is not taken in the
    <term>exclusive</term> sense:
    if both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both true,
    then <m>A\vee B</m> is true as well.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        From this we can see that the truth-value of
        <q><m>2</m> is even or <m>57</m> is prime</q>
        is True.
      </p>
    </statement>

    Once you have these basic connectives,
    you can combine statements to your heart's content,
    and you can analyze the results.

      <p>
        For example,
        let's have a look at the statement <m>(A \vee B) \wedge C</m>.
        Let's analyze the truth table by dealing with what's in parentheses first,
        and then combining that with the statement <m>C</m>:

      <p>
        This is the kind of sentence that we don't say too often in natural language (at least,
        outside of the legal profession):
        it asserts that both <m>A \vee B</m> is true and <m>C</m> is true.
        Maybe a reasonable way to say this in English is
        <q>Either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> is true,
        and <m>C</m> is true too.</q>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The previous example brings up a critical issue.
        <term>We must write our connectives carefully!</term>
        For example, consider the statement
        <me>
          \text{ ``\(57\) is prime or \(2\) is  and \(937\) is prime.'' }
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        What do we mean by this statement?
        As written, it's ambiguous, and that ambiguity affects the truth-value!
      </p>
      <p>
        Parentheses clarify things: the statement
        <me>
          \text{ ``(\(937\) is prime or \(2\) is even) and \(57\) is prime'' }
        </me>
        is false, whereas the statement
        <me>
          \text{ ``\(937\) is prime or (\(2\) is even and \(57\) is prime)'' }
        </me>
        is true.
      </p>
