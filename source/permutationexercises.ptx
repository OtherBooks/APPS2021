  <p>
    The relevant exercises to this section are in Chapter 20 of Liebeck.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the permutation
        <me>
          f=\left(\begin{matrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \amp  7 \amp  8 \cr3  \amp   5 \amp    4   \amp  8  \amp   7  \amp   6  \amp   2  \amp   1 \end{matrix} \right)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Write <m>f, f^{2}</m>, <m>f^{-1}</m>,
        and <m>f^{146}</m> in cycle notation.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <me>
        f=(1 \; 3 \; 4 \; 8 )(2 \; 5 \;7 ) ,\;\; f^2 = (1 \; 4)(2 \; 7 \; 5)(3 \; 8 ),\;\; f^{-1} = (8 \; 4 \; 3 \; 1)(7 \; 5 \; 2)
      </me>
      <p>
        To compute <m>f^{146}</m>,
        note thatthe order of <m>f</m> is <m>lcm(4,3)=12</m>,
        and <m>146  = 12\cdot 12 + 2</m>, thus
        <me>
          f^{146} = (f^{12})^{12}\cdot f^2 = f^2 = (1 \; 4)(2 \; 7 \; 5)(3 \; 8 )
        </me>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given <m>2\leq k\leq n</m>,
        how many <m>k</m>-cycles are there in <m>S_{n}</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        There are <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways of picking numbers
        <m>\{a_{1},...,a_{k}\}</m> in <m>\{1,2,...,n\}</m>.
        Now we count how many cycles there are on these numbers via the multiplication principle.
        For a cycle <m>f=(f_{1} \; \cdots  f_{k})</m> with <m>f_{i}\in  \{a_{1},...,a_{k}\}</m>,
        remember that we also have
        <me>
          f=(f_{2} \; f_{3}\cdots f_{k} \; f_{1}) =(f_{3} \; f_{4} \cdots f_{k} \; f_{1} \; f_{2})\cdots
        </me>
        and so we can assume that <m>f_{1} = a_{1}</m>,
        otherwise we can shift the numbers in the cycle as above until the first term in parentheses is <m>a_{1}</m>.
        Then there are <m>k-1</m> choices for what <m>f_{2}</m> can be,
        and after picking that there are <m>k-2</m> choices for what <m>f_{3}</m> can be,
        and so on.
        Thus, by the multiplication principle,
        there are <m>k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1=(k-1)!</m> many cycles using the numbers <m>\{a_{1},...,a_{k}\}</m>,
        and thus there are
        <me>
          {n \choose k} (k-1)!
        </me>
        many <m>k</m> cylces in <m>S_{n}</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        How many order <m>3</m> permutations are there in <m>S_{4}</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The only way a permutation in <m>S_{4}</m> can have order <m>3</m> is if it is a <m>3</m>-cycle,
        so by the previous exercise,
        the number of such cycles is <m>{4 \choose 3}(3-1)!</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        How many order <m>3</m> permutations are there in <m>S_{6}</m>?
      </p>
      <solution>
        <p>
          By looking at the cycle notation for a permutation <m>f\in S_{6}</m>,
          the only way it can have order <m>3</m> is if it is either a <m>3</m>-cycle or a product of two disjoint <m>3</m>-cycles.
          As in one of the previous exercises,
          there are <m>{6\choose 3}\cdot 2</m> <m>3</m>-cycles.
          To count disjoint products of <m>3</m>-cycles,
          notice that for each <m>3</m>-cycle <m>p</m> there are
          <m>(3-1)!=2</m> <m>3</m>-cycles <m>q</m> we can have on the remaining <m>3</m> numbers in
          <m>\{1,...,6\}</m> not appearing in <m>p</m>.
          If we count them in this way though,
          each product of two disjoint <m>3</m>-cycles is counted twice
          (once as <m>pq</m> and then as <m>qp</m>),
          so we have to divide our answer by <m>2</m>,
          so the number of products of disjoint <m>3</m> cycles is
          <me>
            \left( {6\choose 3} \cdot 2\right) \cdot 2\cdot\frac{1}{2} = {6\choose 3} \cdot 2
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
      <p>
        Thus, the total number of order <m>3</m> permutations is <m>{6\choose 3} \cdot 2+ {6\choose 3} \cdot 2= {6\choose 3} \cdot 4</m>.
      </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say a set <m>S\subseteq S_n</m> <term>generates</term>
        <m>f\in S_{n}</m> there are
        <m>f_{1},...,f_{k}\in S</m> so that <m>f=f_{1}\cdots f_{k}</m>
        (where we could have <m>k=1</m>, that is,
        this could just be a composition of just one function),
        and <m>S</m> <term>generates</term>
        <m>S_{n}</m> if it generates <m>f</m> for every <m>f\in S_{n}</m>.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Show that if <m>f\in S</m>,
              then <m>S</m> generates <m>\iota</m> and <m>f^{-1}</m>.
              <solution>
                <p>
                  Recall that each permutation has an order <m>r</m>,
                  and so <m>\iota = f^{r}</m> and
                  <m>f^{-1} = f^{r-1}</m> are both products of elements of <m>S</m>
                  (in particular,
                  just products of <m>f</m> with itself over and over).
                </p>
              </solution>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Show that <m>S=\{ (1\; 2), (2 \; 3),...,(n-1 \; n)\}</m> generates <m>S_{n}</m>.
              <solution>
                <p>
                  Let <m>f\in S_{n}</m>.
                  Since <m>f</m> is a composition of cycles by Proposition 20.3, we just need to show that each cycle is a composition of functions in <m>S</m>.
                  So let <m>(a_{1}....a_{r})</m> be one of the cycles.
                  The claim will follow from the following subclaim:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Subclaim:</em> If <m>(a_{1}...a_{r})</m> is an <m>r</m>-cycle,
                  then it is a composition of functions from <m>S</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that by the proof of <xref ref="l_prodof2cycles">Lemma</xref>
                  (Proposition 20.6 in the book),
                  <me>
                    (a_{1}\; \cdots \; a_{r}) = (a_{1} \; a_{r})\cdots (a_{1}\; a_{2})
                  </me>,
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, it suffices to show that the cycles <m>(1 \; j)</m> where
                  <m>1\lt j\leq n</m> are compositions of functions from <m>S</m>.
                  We will prove this by induction on <m>j=2,...,n</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If <m>j=2</m>,
                  then this is immediate since <m>(1\;2)\in S</m> already.
                  This proves the base case.
                  Now we prove the induction step.
                  Assume we have shown that <m>(1\; j)</m> is a composition of functions from <m>S</m> for some <m>1\lt j\lt n</m>.
                  Then
                  <me>
                    (1 \; j+1) = (1 \; j)(j\; j+1)(1 \; j)
                  </me>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We already have <m>(j\; j+1)\in S</m>,
                  and <m>(1\; j)</m> is a composition of functions from <m>S</m> by the induction hypothesis,
                  hence so is <m>(1 \; j+1)</m>,
                  which proves the induction step.
                </p>
              </solution>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Show that <m>T=\{(1\; 2),(1\; 2 \; 3),..., (1 \; 2 \; ...\; n)\}</m> generates <m>S_{n}</m>.
              <solution>
                <p>
                  Note that since <m>(1 \; 2 \; \cdots \; k-1 )\in T</m>,
                  <m>T</m> generates <m>(1 \; 2 \; \cdots \; k-1 )^{-1}</m>,
                  and so it also generates
                  <me>
                    (1 \; 2 \; \cdots \; k-1 )^{-1} (1 \; 2 \; \cdots \; k-1 \; k) =(k-1 \; k)
                  </me>
                  for every <m>k</m>.
                  We have already shown that every <m>f</m> is a product of elements in <m>S_{n}</m> is a product of permutations of the form <m>(k-1\; k)</m>,
                  and now we have shown that each such permutation is a product of elements in <m>T</m>,
                  thus <m>T</m> generates <m>S_n</m>.

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given <m>x,y\in S_{n}</m>,
        we call <m>z=xyx^{-1}</m> the <term>conjugate of <m>y</m> by <m>x</m></term>.
        If <m>z=xyx^{-1}</m> for some <m>x\in S_{n}</m>,
        we say <m>z</m> is a <term>conjugate</term> of <m>y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Show that the relation <m>y\sim z</m> if <m>y</m> is conjugate to <m>z</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>S_{n}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Fix <m>x\in S_{n}</m>.
        Show that the function sending <m>y\in S_{n}</m> to
        <m>xyx^{-1}</m> is a bijection on <m>S_{n}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) If <m>c=(a_{1} \; a_{2}...a_{k})</m> is a cycle in <m>S_{n}</m> and <m>x\in S_{n}</m>,
        prove that
        <me>
          xcx^{-1}=(x(a_{1})...x(a_{k}))
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) If <m>y,z</m> are conjugates,
        what can you say about their cycle shapes?
        Is the converse also true?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        (a) Clearly <m>y\sim y</m> since <m>y=\iota y\iota^{-1}</m>,
        so <m>\sim</m> is reflexive.
        If <m>y\sim z</m>, then <m>y=xzx^{-1}</m> for some <m>x\in S_{n}</m>.
        Composing both sides on the left with <m>x^{-1}</m>,
        we get <m>x^{-1}y=zx^{-1}</m>,
        and then composing again on the right gives <m>x^{-1}yx=z</m>,
        and so <m>z</m> is a conjugate of <m>y</m>,
        hence <m>z\sim y</m> and we have reflexivity.
        Finally, if <m>y\sim z</m> and <m>z\sim w</m>,
        then <m>y=xzx^{-1}</m> and
        <m>z=sws^{-1}</m> for some <m>x,s\in S_{n}</m>.
        Then <m>y=xzx^{-1} = xswx^{-1}s^{-1} = xsw(xs)^{-1}</m>,
        so <m>y\sim w</m>.
        This proves transitivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Let <m>F(y)=xyx^{-1}</m>.
        Then <m>F</m> is surjective since,
        for every <m>y\in S_{n}</m>, <m>y=F(x^{-1}yx)</m>.
        It is injective since, if <m>xyx^{-1}=xzx^{-1}</m>,
        then we can compose both sides on the left with <m>x^{-1}</m> to get <m>yx^{-1}=zx^{-1}</m>,
        and then compose with <m>x</m> on the right to get <m>y=z</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) If we plug in <m>x(a_{i})</m>
        (this is the function <m>x</m> evaluated at <m>a_{i}</m>),
        we get <m>xcx^{-1}(x(a_{i}))=xc(a_{i})=x(a_{i+1})</m> if <m>i\lt k</m> and when <m>i=k</m>,
        <m>xcx^{-1}(x(a_{k}))=xc(a_{k})=x(a_{1})</m>.
        Thus, <m>xcx^{-1}=(x(a_{1})...x(a_{k}))</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, <m>xcx^{-1}</m> is a cycle of the same length.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) If <m>y,z</m> are conjugates,
        then they have the same cycle-shape.
        If <m>z=xyx^{-1}</m>,
        and <m>y\in S_{n}</m> decomposes into disjoint cycles <m>y=c_{1}\cdots c_{k}</m>, then
        <me>
          xyx^{-1}=xc_{1}x^{-1} xc_{2}x^{-1}\cdots xc_{k}x^{-1}
        </me>,
        so <m>xyx^{-1}</m> is also a composition of cycles of the same lengths,
        and so it has the same cycle-shape as <m>y</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> have the same cycle shape,
        then they are also conjugate.
        To see this,
        note that if <m>y=c_1...c_{r}</m> is a product of disjoint cycles,
        we can write <m>z=d_{1}...d_{r}</m> as a product of cycles so that <m>d_{i}</m> has the same length as <m>c_{i}</m>.
        If <m>c_{i}=(a_{i,1}...a_{i,k_i})</m> and <m>d_{i}=(b_{i,j},...,b_{i,k_{i}})</m>,
        define <m>x\in S_{n}</m> so that <m>x(a_{i,j})=b_{i,j}</m>.
        Then <m>xc_ix^{-1}=(x(a_{i,1})...x(a_{i,k_i}))=(b_{i,1},...,b_{i,k_{i}})=d_i</m>,
        and so <m>xyx^{-1}=z</m>.

        <em>Landau's function</em> <m>L(n)</m> is defined for every
        <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> to be the largest order of an element of <m>S_{n}</m>.
        This has no convenient formula,
        but we will prove some simple bounds on it in the next two exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Show that for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>, <m>L(n)\lt 2^{n}</m>.
        <term>Hint: it may help to show

        <em>Claim:</em> For all <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m>,
        the order of any cycle <m>f\in S_{n}</m> is at most <m>2^{n}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Proof:</em> We first need to show that for all natural numbers <m>n</m>,
        <men xml:id="e_n_2_n">
          n\lt 2^{n}
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (I have shown this in class,
        so students may also just cite the lectures for this fact.) This is true for the base case <m>n=1</m>,
        so suppose <m>n\geq 1</m> is an integer so that <m>2^{n}>n</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          n+1\lt 2^{n}+1\lt 2^{n}+2^{n}=2^{n+1}
        </me>.

        This proves the induction step and hence (1).

      <p>
        Let <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> and let <m>f\in S_{n}</m>.
        Then <m>f</m> can be written as a product of cycles of lengths <m>r_{1},....,r_{k}</m> where
        <m>r_{i}\in \mathbb{N}</m> and <m>r_{1}+\cdots  + r_{k}=n</m>.
        Then the order is the least common multiple of these numbers,
        which is at most
        <me>
          r_{1}\cdots r_{k}\lt 2^{r_{1}}\cdots 2^{r_{k}}=2^{r_{1}+\cdots + r_{k}}=2^{n}

    <p>
      (b) Show that <m>L(n)\geq\frac{n}{2}\cdot \left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)</m> for every <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m>.
      <term>Hint: Remember that <m>L(n)</m> is the maximum order of an element in <m>S_{n}</m>,
      so to prove the above claim,
      you just need to find one element of <m>S_{n}</m> with order at least <m>\frac{n}{2}\cdot \left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)</m>.
      Try playing around with different products of cycles to see how big you can make their order.</term>

        <em>Claim:</em> <m>L(n)\geq\frac{n}{2}\cdot \left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)</m> for <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m>.
      </p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          We split into two cases depending on if <m>n</m> is even or odd.
          If <m>n</m> is even, then <m>n/2</m> and <m>n/2-1</m> are coprime.
          Let <m>f</m> have cycle decomposition
          <me>
            f=(1\; 2\cdots n/2)(n/2+1 \;\; n/2+2...n-1)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then these two cycles have lengths <m>n/2</m> and <m>n/2-1</m> respectively,
          and the order of <m>f</m> is the least common multiple of these two numbers by Proposition 20.4, and since they are comprime,
          this must be <m>\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>n</m> is odd,
          then <m>\frac{n-1}{2}</m> and <m>\frac{n+1}{2}</m> are coprime.
          Let <m>g</m> have cycle decomposition
          <me>
            g=(1\; 2\cdots (n-1)/2)((n+1)/2  ... n)
          </me>
          then the lengths of the cycles in this decomposition are
          <m>\frac{n-1}{2}</m> and <m>\frac{n+1}{2}</m>,
          and so the order of the cycle is the least common multiple of these numbers by Proposition 20.4 which
          (because they are coprime)
          is just their product:
          <m>\frac{n-1}{2}\frac{n+1}{2}= \frac{n^2-1}{4}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the minimum of this and <m>\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)</m>,
          we see that <m>L(n)\geq \frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
