  <title>Comparing sizes of sets with functions</title>
  <p>
    In the earlier diagram,
    note that whenever the function is injective there has to be at least as many elements in <m>B</m> as there are in <m>A</m>,
    otherwise the arrows from <m>A</m> couldn't point to distinct points in <m>B</m>.
    Similarly, when the function is surjective,
    there needs to be at least as many points in <m>A</m> as there are in <m>B</m>,
    since the number of arrows
    (and hence the number of places they point to in <m>B</m>)
    is at most the size of <m>A</m>.
    We make this more precise in the following theorem.
    For a finite set <m>A</m>,
    we will let <m>|A|</m> equal the size of <m>A</m>, that is,
    the number of elements in <m>A</m>.

  <theorem xml:id="t_f-size">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be finite sets and let <m>f:X\rightarrow Y</m> be a function.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is injective, then <m>|X|\leq |Y|</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is surjective, then <m>|X|\geq |Y|</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f</m> is bijective, then <m>|X|=|Y|</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Since <m>X</m> is finite,
      we may number the elements <m>\{x_{1},...,x_{n}\}</m> where <m>n=|X|</m>.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>f</m> is injective,
            then the element <m>f(x_{1}),...,f(x_{n})</m> are distinct,
            so there are exactly <m>n</m> elements in the set <m>S=\{f(x_{1}),...,f(x_{n}))\}</m>,
            and since this is a subset of <m>Y</m>,
            <m>Y</m> must have at least as many elements as <m>S</m>,
            so <m>|Y|\geq n=|X|</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>f</m> is surjective,
            then if we number the elements <m>Y=\{y_{1},...,y_{m}\}</m> where <m>m=|Y|</m>,
            then for each <m>i=1,...,m</m>,
            there is <m>s_{i}\in X</m> so that <m>f(s_{i})=y_{i}</m>.
            Each of the <m>s_{i}</m> are distinct,
            since otherwise if <m>s_{i}=s_{j}</m>,
            for some <m>i\neq j</m>, then <m>y_{i}=f(s_{i})=f(s_{j})=y_{j}</m>,
            which is a contradiction since <m>y_{i}</m> and <m>y_{j}</m> are distinct.
            Thus, there are <m>m</m> distinct elements <m>s_{1},...,s_{m}</m> in <m>X</m>,
            and so <m>|X|\geq m=|Y|</m>.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            This follows by combining (1) and (2).
