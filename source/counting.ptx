  <title>Counting</title>

      \epigraph<term> Though combinatorics has been successfully applied to many branches of mathematics,
      these cannot be compared either in importance or in depth to the applications of analysis in number theory or algebra to topology,
      but I hope that time and the ingenuity of the younger generation will change this. </term>{Paul Erd&#337;s, 1970.}

      This week we will introduce <term>combinatorics</term>,
      which is the study of counting.
      As you can see from the above quotation, Paul Erd&#337;s<fn>
      Paul Erd&#337;s was one of the greatest combinatorists in history,
      and the most prolific mathematician,
      publishing at least 1,525 mathematical papers,
      more than any other mathematician
      (though Euler wrote more total pages).
      His life is incredibly interesting as well,
      as he spent a large part of it technically homeless,
      with no permanent address,
      just travelling and staying with other mathematicians.
      For a short summary,
      you can read here ({\url{http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Erdos.html}}), otherwise his biography
      <term> The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</term> is a great read.
      </fn> felt that combinatorics played second fiddle to the fields of analysis and algebra.
      However, with the advent of computer science,
      combinatorics became essential for building efficient algorithms,
      and thus has a much larger importance for society than Erd&#337;s could have anticipated back in 1970.
