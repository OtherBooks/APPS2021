  <title>Conjunction</title>
  <p>
    One can combine statements together to get new statements.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are statements,
        their <term>conjunction</term> is the statement <m>A \text{ and }   B</m>.
        Some authors use the notations <m>A \wedge B</m> or
        <m>A \\amp  B</m> for the conjunction of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
        For example, if <m>A</m> is the statement
        <q><m>2</m> is even</q>
        and <m>B</m> is the statement
        <q><m>57</m> is prime,</q>
        the statement <m>A \wedge B</m> asserts that
        <q><m>2</m> is even and <m>57</m> is prime.</q>
        The truth-value of the conjunction operates like this:
        <me>
          A \wedge B \text{ is true exactly when both } A\text{ is true and } B\text{ is true }
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    To unpack this, we use of a <term>truth table</term>.
    When we combine statements <m>A</m>,
    <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, etc. to get a statement <m>P</m>,
    a truth table is then a list of the truth-values of <m>P</m> depending on the truth-values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    Here is the truth table for the conjunction:
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell><m>A</m></cell>
      <cell><m>B</m></cell>
      <cell><m>A \wedge B</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
      <cell>F</cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        From our truth table, we can see that the truth-value of
        <q><m>2</m> is even and <m>57</m> is prime</q>
        is False.
      </p>
    </statement>
