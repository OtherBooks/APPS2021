  <title>Table Notation</title>
  <p>
    Here we will introduce some useful notation for denoting permutations.
    To represent a permutation <m>f\in S_n</m>,
    we just need to remember where each integer
    <m>k\in \{1,2,...,n\}</m> gets sent to under <m>f</m> and then write out a chart using a matrix:
    <me>
      \left(\begin{matrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  \cdots \amp  n \crf(1) \amp  f(2) \amp  f(3) \amp  \cdots \amp  f(n) \cr \end{matrix} \right)
    </me>
    where the first row represents the domain of <m>f</m> and the bottom row represents where each value is sent to under <m>f</m>.
    For example,
    <me>
      \left(\begin{matrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3  \\ 3 \amp  1 \amp  2 \end{matrix} \right)
    </me>
    is the permutation in <m>S_{3}</m> so that <m>f(1)=3</m>,
    <m>f(2)=1</m>, and <m>f(3)=2</m>.

    <statement>
      <me>
        \left(\begin{matrix}1 \amp  2 \amp  3 \amp  4 \amp  5 \amp  6 \amp  7  \amp  8 \amp  9 \amp  10 \cr7 \amp  5 \amp  1 \amp  \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\bigstar} \amp  9 \amp  2 \amp  10 \amp  4 \amp  3 \amp  8\cr
        \end{matrix} \right)
      </me>
      <p>
        denotes a permutation in <m>\mathrm{S}_{10}</m>.
        What is <m>\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\bigstar}</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Recall that permutations are bijective,
        which means that every number must appear
        <term>exactly once</term> in the second row.
        The only number missing is <m>6</m>,
        so the number under <m>\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\bigstar}</m> must be 6.
