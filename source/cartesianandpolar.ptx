  <title>Cartesian and Polar form</title>
  <p>
    Another useful representation of a complex number <m>z=x+iy</m> is <term>polar form</term>.
    In polar form we represent a complex number by specifying an angle <m>\theta</m> from the <m>x</m> axis,
    and a distance from the origin which, recall, is <m>|z|</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>z\neq 0</m> be a complex number.
        Let <m>r = |z|</m> and define the <term>argument</term>
        of <m>z</m> be the angle <m>\theta\in [0,2\pi)</m> between the line from <m>0</m> to <m>z</m> and the positive <m>x</m>-axis.
        We can then write
        <me>
          z= r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the <term>polar form</term> of <m>z</m>.

    If we look at the triangle in the above figure,
    the hypotenuse is <m>r=|z|</m>,
    and so the base and height of the triangle are
    <m>r\cos \theta</m> and <m>r\sin\theta</m> respectively,
    and so these give the real and imaginary parts (i.e. the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates) of <m>z</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we specify that the argument <m>\theta</m> of a complex number <m>z</m> to be in the range <m>[0,2\pi)</m>,
    there are infinitely many numbers <m>\phi</m> so that
    <m>z= r(\cos\phi+i\sin\phi)</m> (where <m>r=|z|</m>):
    we can just take <m>\phi = \theta+ 2n\pi</m> for <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
    We have made a choice to only take <m>\theta\in [0,2\pi)</m>.
    This is called the <term>principal argument</term>.
    Other books and resources sometimes choose <m>\theta\in (-\pi,\pi]</m>.
    Mathematicians are free to
    <q>cut</q>
    the complex plane where we choose,
    but be clear about which choice you make and stick to it.
    For PPS only take <m>\theta\in [0,2\pi)</m>,
    unless otherwise stated clearly.
