  <title>Permutations</title>
  <p>
    This week we combine the techniques of the last two weeks to study a particular class of functions called permutations.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>,
        denote by <m>\mathrm{S}_{n}</m> the set of all bijections
        <me>
          \big\{1,2,3,4,\ldots,n\big\}\longrightarrow\big\{1,2,3,4,\ldots,n\big\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call elements in <m>\mathrm{S}_{n}</m> permutations of the set <m>\{1,2,3,4,\ldots,n\}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As we saw last week,
    permutations are important for combinatorics and counting.
    They are also interesting from an algebraic perspective:
    as we'll see below.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set <m>\mathrm{S}_{1}</m> consists of one bijection
        <m>f:\mathrm{S}_{1}\rightarrow\mathrm{S}_{1}</m> defined by <m>f(1)=1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The set <m>\mathrm{S}_{2}</m> consists of two bijections:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              a function <m>f</m> such that <m>f(1)=1</m> and <m>f(2)=2</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              a function <m>g</m> such that <m>g(1)=2</m> and <m>g(2)=1</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We know exactly how many permutations there are on <m>S_{n}</m>.
  </p>
  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set <m>\mathrm{S}_n</m> consists of exactly <m>n!</m> permutations.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Permutations in <m>S_{n}</m> are just ways of rearranging the numbers <m>\{1,2,...,n\}</m> written in order.
      That is, we can identify each rearrangement of numbers
      <m>\{1,2,...,n\}</m> written in order with the unique function which maps
      <m>\{1,2,...,n\}</m> onto that rearrangement.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Notice that each element <m>f\in S_{n}</m> is actually a function.
    So, we are dealing with the whole function itself,
    <m>f</m> and not just with the value of the function <m>f(n)</m> for some number <m>n</m>.
