    The following theorem is the starting point for our studies on divisibility.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <title>The Remainder Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>a\in\mathbb{N}</m> and <m>b\in\mathbb{Z}</m>.
        There are unique integers <m>q\in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>0\leq r\lt a</m> such that
        <me>
          b=qa+r
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We prove existence and uniqueness separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Existence:</em> Let <m>q</m> be the largest integer for which <m>qa\leq b</m>.
      Let <m>r=b-qa\geq 0</m>.
      Then we must also have <m>r\lt a</m>,
      since if <m>r\geq a</m>,
      then <m>b-qa\geq a</m>, and so <m>b-(q+1)a\geq 0</m>,
      which contradicts <m>q</m> being the largest integer for which <m>qa\leq b</m>.
      This shows the existence of a pair <m>(q,r)</m> satisfying the theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Uniqueness:</em> Assume that <m>(q',r')</m> is a pair of integers such that
      <m>b=q'a+r'</m> and <m>0\leq r'\lt a</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        0=b-b=q'a+r'-qa-r = (q'-q)a+(r'-r)
      </me>,
      and so
      <me>
        r'-r=(q-q')a
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>0\leq r,r'\lt a</m>,
      we know <m>|r-r'|\lt a</m>.
      Thus
      <me>
        a>|r-r'|=|(q-q')a|=|q-q'|\cdot a
      </me>,
      which implies that <m>1>|q-q'|</m>.
      Since <m>|q-q'|</m> is a nonnegative integer,
      it therefore follows that <m>q=q'</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> we say
        <term><m>a</m> divides <m>b</m></term>
        if there is an integer <m>c</m> so that <m>b=ac</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some authors will write <m>a | b</m> for the sentence
        <q><m>a</m> divides <m>b</m>.</q>
        (This isn't great notation.)
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    So for example, <m>2</m> divides <m>4</m>,
    but <m>2</m> does not divide <m>3</m>.

  <lemma xml:id="l_abba">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>a</m> divides <m>b</m> and <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>,
        then <m>a=\pm b</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
