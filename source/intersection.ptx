      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> be two sets.
        The <term>intersection</term>
        <m>S \cap T</m> is the set consisting of the elements <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> have in common.
        That is, <m>x \in S \cap T</m> exactly when both <m>x \in S</m> and <m>x \in T</m>.
        One can write
        <me>
          S \cap T = \{x : (x \in S) \wedge (x \in T)\}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    When <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> are subsets of some common set <m>U</m> and are given by set-builder notation,
    we can use conjunction to describe the intersection.
    That is, if
    <me>
      S = \{x \in U : A(x) \}
    </me>
    for a statement <m>A(x)</m>, and if
    <me>
      T = \{x \in U : B(x) \}
    </me>
    for a statement <m>B(x)</m>, then the intersection is given by
    <me>
      S \cap T = \{x \in U : A(x) \wedge B(x)\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sets
        <me>
          S = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} : n\text{ is divisible by } 2\} \text{ and }  T = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} : n\text{ is divisible by } 5\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the intersection is
        <me>
          S \cap T = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} : n\text{ is divisible by both } 2\text{ and } 5\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this you can see that:
        <me>
          S \cap T = \{n \in \mathbb{Z} : n\text{ is divisible by } 10\}=\{\dots,-20,-10,0,10,20,\dots\}
        </me>.
      </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the sets
        <me>
          S = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \geq 0\}
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          T = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \leq 1\}
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the intersection is
        <me>
          S \cap T = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \leq x \leq 1 \}
        </me>,
        the set of real numbers between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>
        (including <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>). (This set is called the
        <term>closed interval</term>
        from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>,
        and it is often written as <m>[0,1]</m>.)

        Then the intersection is

          S \cap T = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : (x \geq 1)\wedge(x \leq 0) \} = \varnothing
