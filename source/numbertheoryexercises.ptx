  <introduction>
    <p>
      The relevant exercises in Liebeck's book are in Chapters 10 and 11.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>n</m> and <m>n^2+n+1</m> are coprime.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>d=\gcd(n,n^2+n+1)</m>.
          By The Linear Combination Lemma,
          <me>
            d\text{ divides }  n^2+n+1 - n\cdot n = n+1
          </me>
          and so we also have <m>d</m> divides <m>n+1 - n =1</m>,
          thus <m>n</m> and <m>n^2+n+1</m> are coprime.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> so that <m>n-2</m> divides <m>n^2-2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Note that <m>n-2</m> divides <m>n^2-4</m>,
          so The Linear Combination Lemma implies
          <me>
            n-2\text{ divides }  (n^2-2-(n^2-4))=2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>n-2</m> must be <m>\pm 1</m> or <m>\pm 2</m>,
          and this is only possible if <m>n=1,3</m> or <m>4</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>\gcd(n!+1,(n+1)!)</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>n+1</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>d=\gcd(n!+1,(n+1)!)</m>.
          By The Linear Combination Lemma,
          <me>
            d \text{ divides }  (n+1)(n!+1)-(n+1)! = n+1
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>d>1</m> and <m>k\lt n+1</m> is such that <m>d|k</m>,
          then by The Linear Combination Lemma
          <me>
            d \text{ divides }  n!+1- k\cdot \frac{n!}{k} =1
          </me>
          a contradiction,
          thus <m>d</m> cannot divide any number less than <m>n+1</m> bigger than <m>1</m>,
          so <m>d</m> is either <m>1</m> or <m>n+1</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Below, if an exercise just states an equation,
      find all integer solutions to that equation.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>x^2=16y^2+8y+2</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First note that if <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution, so is <m>(-x,y)</m>,
          so we can assume first that <m>x\geq 0</m>.Note that <m>x^2=16y^2+8y+2</m> implies
          <me>
            x^2-1 =16y^2+8y+1=(4y+1)^2
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this implies <m>x\neq 0</m>, thus <m>x>0</m>.
          Note that <m>x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)</m>,
          so their gcd is at most <m>2</m>,
          but <m>x^2-1=(4y+1)^2</m> which is odd,
          thus <m>x\pm 1</m> are coprime.
          Thus, they are perfect squares that differ by <m>2</m>,
          so <m>x+1=m^2</m> and <m>x-1=n^2</m>
          (since <m>x>0</m>, both <m>x\pm 1\geq 0</m>).
          We can assume <m>m>n\geq 0</m>.
          But then
          <me>
            2= x+1-(x-1) = m^2-n^2 = (m-n)(m+n)
          </me>,
          so we must have that <m>m-n=1</m> and <m>m+n=2</m>
          (since <m>m-n\leq m+n</m>),
          which has no integer solutions.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>x^2+2y^2=8z+5</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <em>Claim:</em> There are no integer solutions to <m>x^2+2y^2=8z+5</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>(x,y,z)</m> was an integer solution.
            Notice that <m>8z+5</m> is odd,
            so <m>x^2+2y^2</m> is odd as well,
            thus <m>x^2</m> is odd, and so <m>x</m> is odd.
            Thus, <m>x=2n+1</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
            Plugging that back into the above, we get
            <me>
              8z+5 =x^2+2y^2 = (2n+1)^2 +2y^2 = 4n^2 +4n+1 + 2y^2
            </me>
            and so
            <me>
              8z+4 = 4n^2+4n+2y^2
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dividing both sides by <m>2</m>, we get
            <me>
              4z+2=2n^2+2n+y^3
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, <m>y^3</m> must be even,
            so <m>y</m> is even, hence <m>y=2m</m> for some <m>m</m>,
            so we get
            <me>
              4z+2-2n^2-2n=y^3=8m^3
            </me>
            and dividing through by <m>2</m> gives
            <me>
              2z+1-n^2-n = 4m^3
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But notice that <m>2z+1-n^2-n = 2z-n(n+1)+1</m> is odd,
            because <m>n(n+1)</m> is even and so is <m>2z</m>,
            but <m>4m^3</m> is even, and we get a contradiction.
            Thus, there are no solutions.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>x^2 = y^3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <em>Claim:</em> We have the following: The integer solutions of <m>x^2=y^3</m> are of the form <m>x=n^3</m>,
          <m>y=n^2</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            It is clear to see that letting
            <m>x=n^3, y=n^2</m> for any integer <m>n</m> solves the equation.
            So we need to show that this is in fact necessary, not only sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let <m>(x,y)</m> be a solution to <m>x^2=y^3</m>.
            Note that if <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution, then so is <m>(-x,y)</m>,
            and moreover, <m>y\geq 0</m> since <m>y^3=x^2\geq 0</m>.
            Thus, we can assume for the moment that <m>x,y\geq 0</m>,
            since if <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution with <m>x\lt 0</m>,
            then <m>(-x,y)</m> will be a positive solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <m>x,y\geq 0</m>, we can look at their prime factorizations.
            Let us write <m>x=p_1^{k_1}\cdots p_n^{k_n}</m> and
            <m>y=q_1^{l_1}\cdots q_m^{l_m}</m> for the prime factorizations for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> respectively,
            (so we assume <m>p_i\lt p_j</m> for <m>i\lt j</m>,
            and <m>q_r\lt q_s</m> for <m>r\lt s</m>).
            Then we have:
            <me>
              p_1^{2k_1}\cdots p_n^{2k_n} = x^2=y^3 = q_1^{3l_1}\cdots q_m^{3l_m}
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, applying the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to <m>x^2</m>,
            we have <m>m=n</m>, <m>p_i=q_i</m>,
            for each <m>i</m>, and moreover,
            <me>
              2k_i=3l_i
            </me>,
            for each <m>i</m>.
            Since 2 and 3 are coprime, Proposition 10.5 implies that <m>k_i</m> is divisible by 3 and <m>l_i</m> is divisible by 2.
            Let <m>k_i'=\frac{k_i}{3}</m>.
            Let <m>n:= p_1^{k_1'}\cdots p_n^{k_n'}</m>.
            Then <m>x=n^3</m> and <m>y=n^2</m>, as claimed.
            That is, if <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution with <m>x,y\geq 0</m>,
            then <m>(x,y)=(n^3,n^2)</m> for some <m>n\geq 0</m>.
            Thus, if <m>(x,y)</m> is <term>any </term> solution,
            then <m>(x,y)=(\pm n^3,n^2)</m> for some <m>n\geq 0</m>,
            or alternatively,
            <m>(x,y)=(n^3,n^2)</m> for some <m>n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>x^3-y^3=7</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <em>Claim:</em> The only solutions <m>(x,y)</m> are <m>(2,1)</m> and <m>(-1,-2)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>(x,y)</m> is a solution.
            First note that this implies <m>x^3>y^3</m>, and so <m>x>y</m>.
            Furthermore,
            we immediately see that <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m> don't lead to solutions,
            so we can assume that <m>x\neq 0 \neq y</m> as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Factoring, we see that
            <me>
              7 = x^3-y^3= (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, <m>x-y</m> divides <m>7</m>,
            and since <m>x>y</m>, this means <m>x-y>0</m>,
            so the only possibilities then are <m>x-y=1</m> or <m>x-y=7</m>.
            We split into two cases:
            <ol label="labelalph">
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>x-y=1</m>.
                  Then we have that <m>x=y+1</m>, and so
                  <me>
                    7=x^3-y^3= (y+1)^3-y^3 = 3y^2+3y+1
                  </me>,
                  thus <m>6=3y^2+y</m>, so <m>2=y^2+y=y(y+1)</m>,
                  so we see that <m>y</m> divides <m>2</m> and <m>y+1</m> divides <m>2</m>.
                  The only way this is possible is if either <m>y=1</m> or <m>y=-2</m>.
                  By plugging these values into the original equation,
                  we see that the solutions are in this case <m>(x,y)=(2,1)</m> and <m>(-1,-2)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Suppose <m>x-y=7</m>.
                  Then
                  <me>
                    7=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)=7(x^2+xy+y^2)
                  </me>
                  implies
                  <me>
                    1=(x^2+xy+y^2)
                  </me>.
                  Note that if <m>|x|\geq |y|</m>,
                  then <m>xy\geq -|x|\cdot |y|\geq -|x|^2=-x^2</m>,
                  and so the above is at least
                  <me>
                    1\geq x^2-x^2=y^2>0
                  </me>
                  since we are assuming <m>y\neq 0</m>.
                  Hence, <m>y^2=1</m>, so <m>y=\pm 1</m>.
                  Again, we can plug these into our original equation
                  <m>7=x^3-y^3</m> and we find that <m>y=-1</m> leads to no solution and <m>y=1</m> leads to
                  <m>(x,y)=(2,1)</m>, which we already found.
                  Thus, the solutions are just <m>(x,y)=(2,1)</m> and <m>(-1,-2)</m>.

        <p>
          <em>Claim:</em> The only solutions <m>(x,y)</m> are <m>(1,0)</m>,

          <m>(9,2)</m>, and <m>(10,3)</m>.
        </p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            First, let's rearrange and factor:
            <me>
              2y^2=xy-x-y+1 = (x-1)(y-1)
            </me>
            and since <m>\gcd(y,y-1)=1</m>,
            we know <m>y-1</m> divides <m>2</m>, thus <m>y-1=-1,1,-2</m>,
            or <m>2</m>, that is, <m>y=0,2,-1</m>, or <m>3</m>.
            We can now just try al these values out to see what <m>x</m> should be:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <title>invalidlabel</title>
                <p>
                  In this case, <m>0=(x-1)(0-1)=1-x</m>, i.e.
                  <m>x=1</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <title>invalidlabel</title>
                <p>
                  In this case, <m>2=2y^2=(x-1)(y-1)=-2(x-1)</m>, so <m>x=0</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <title>invalidlabel</title>
                <p>
                  We see that <m>8=2y^2 = (x-1)(y-1)=x-1</m>, and so <m>x=9</m>,
                  and the solution in this case is <m>(x,y)=(9,2)</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <title>invalidlabel</title>
                <p>
                  We see that <m>18=2y^2 = (x-1)(y-1)=2(x-1)</m>, and so <m>x=10</m>,
                  and the solution in this case is <m>(x,y)=(10,3)</m>.
                </p>

            so it is either <m>1</m> or <m>2</m>.
            Note that since <m>2</m> does not divide <m>2y+1</m>,
            the prime factorization of

            In particular, <m>x-1</m> and <m>x+1</m> can't both be even,
            so the only even number is <m>x</m>,
            hence <m>\gcd(x-1,x+1)=1</m>.
            Since <m>x</m> only has one 2 in its prime factorization,
            <m>\frac{x}{2}</m> is an integer and <m>x\pm 1</m> and

        <proof>
          <p>
            Assume that <m>(x, y, z)</m> is a solution in positive integers.
            Clearly, <m>x</m> is divisible by <m>3</m>,
            so <m>x= 3x_1</m> for some positive integer <m>x_1</m>.
            But then <m>27x_{1}^{3}+3y^3+9z^3= 0</m>,hence <m>9x_1^3+y^3+3z^3= 0</m>.
            Now <m>y= 3y_1</m>, and we find <m>3x_1^3+9y^{3}_{1}+z^3= 0</m>.
            Finally, <m>z= 3z_1</m> for some positive integer <m>z_1</m>,
            and <m>x_{1}^{3}+ 3y_{1}^{3}+ 9z_{1}^{3}= 0</m>.Thus if
            <m>(x, y, z)</m> is a, integer solution of the equation <m>x^3+3y^3+9z^3= 0</m>,
            then so is <m>(x/3,y/3,z/3)</m>.
            Repeating this argument we find that for every positive solution there is a smaller solution in positive integers:
            but this is nonsense, thus there is no solution in positive integers.

          For part (a), the fact that
          <m>|a+b\sqrt{-5}|=\sqrt{a^{2}+5b^{2}}</m> juts follows from the definition of the modulus of a complex number.
          In particular,
          if <m>z=a+b\sqrt{-5}</m> has modulus 1, then <m>1=|z|^{2}=a^{2}+5b^{2}</m>,
          and the only way this can happen is if <m>b=0</m> and <m>a=1</m>
          (since a and b are integers).
        </p>
        <p>
          For part b, we can prove this by strong induction on <m>|z|^2</m>.
          If <m>|z|^2=1</m>,
          then <m>z</m> must be <m>\pm 1</m>, which is a primo
          (since if we have <m>xy=z</m>,
          then <m>1=|z|=|xy|=|x||y|</m>, so <m>|x|=|y|=1</m>,
          and hence <m>x,y=\pm 1</m>, that is,
          they are both equal to plus or minus z).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose we know that claim b holds for all <m>z</m> with
          <m>|z|^2\leq n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>.
          Let <m>z</m> now be an element with <m>|z|^2=n+1</m>.
          If it is not primo,
          then there is a way of writing z as <m>xy</m> where neither x or y are equal to plus or minus z, so in particular,
          neither of them are <m>\pm 1</m> either.
          By part (a),
          since neither of them are 1, then <m>|x|,|y|>1</m>,
          and <m>|z|=|xy|=|x||y|</m>, so <m>1\lt |x|^2=|z|^2/|y|^2\lt |z|^2=n+1</m>.
          Thus, <m>x</m> can be factored into a product of primos by the induction hypothesis,
          and y can be similarly.
          This proves the induction step.
        </p>
        <p>
          For c, note that 2 is primo since otherwise 2 can be written as a product of two numbers with modulus less than 2, but then they must have modulus 1, and so they must be <m>\pm1</m>,
          which is impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 is primo since if it were the product of two numbers xy with modulus less than 3, then they would have to either be <m>\pm 1</m> or <m>\pm 2</m>,
          which don't multiply up to 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>1+\sqrt{-5}</m> is primo since,
          if it were written as a product <m>xy</m> with neither of x or y equal to 1 or <m>1+\sqrt{-5}</m>,
          notice that <m>|x|\cdot |y|=|xy|=|1+\sqrt{-5}|=\sqrt{1+5}=\sqrt{6}</m>,
          so <m>|x|,|y|\leq \sqrt{6}</m>,
          and the only numbers for which this holds are <m>\pm 1</m> and <m>\pm 2</m>.

    <title>Challenging Exercise: A special case of Fermat's last theorem*</title>
    <p>
      In this exercise we will show that <m>x^4 + y^4 = z^4</m>
      (the Fermat quartic)
      has no <term>nontrivial solutions</term>,
      that is, no integer solutions apart from <m>(x,y,z)=0</m>.
      The method we will use is known as
      <q>infinite descent</q>: we suppose there is a solution <m>(x,y,z)</m> with <m>z>0</m>,
      then we assume <m>(x,y,z)</m> has <m>z</m> smallest among all such solutions,
      then we show that we can find another solution <m>(u,v,w)</m> with <m>w\lt z</m>,
      contradicting that <m>z</m> was the smallest integer appearing in a solution to <m>x^4+y^4=z^4</m>.
      This is quite difficult and wouldn't be expected of you on a homework or exam,
      it's just a bit of fun.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why it suffices to only find positive solutions?

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Why does it suffice to show
            <m>x^4+y^4=z^2</m> has no nontrivial integer solutions?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose there is a non-trivial solution positive solution to <m>x^4 + y^4 = z^2</m>.
            Then there is a solution <m>(x,y,z)</m> with smallest <m>z>0</m> among all solutions.
            Show that <m>x,y,z</m> have no common factors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Show that exactly one of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> is odd.
            Now assume <m>x</m> is odd and <m>y</m> is even.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Note that <m>a=x^2</m> and <m>b=y^2</m> along with <m>c=z</m> form a Pythagorean triple,
            <m>a</m> is odd, and <m>x,y,z</m> are coprime.
            Hence, by our work on classifying Pythagorean triples,
            we must have
            <me>
              (a,b,c) = \left( as^2 t^2, a\frac{s^2-t^2}{2}, a\frac{s^{2}+t^{2}}{2}\right)
            </me>
            for some <m>s>t</m>.
            Show that <m>4</m> divides <m>s-t</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Using that <m>(s-t)(s+t)=2b=2y^2</m>,
            show that there are integers <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> with <m>s+t = 2u^2</m> and <m>s-t=4v^2</m>,
            and <m>u</m> and <m>2v</m> are relatively prime. solving for <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>,
            verify that <m>x^2+4v^4 = u^4</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>A = x</m>, <m>B = 2v^2</m> and <m>C = u^2</m>.
            Show that this is another Pythagorean triple of the form described in the parametrization theorem.
            So they can be expressed as above for <m>(a,b,c)</m>,
            but with parameters <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> instead of <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Arguing in a similar fashion to (d),
            show that <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> satisfy <m>S+T = 2X^2</m> and
            <m>S-T=2Y^2</m> for some positive integers<m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Solve for <m>S</m> and <m>T</m> and verify that <m>u^2 = X^4 + Y^4</m>.
            Finally show that <m>uXY\neq 0</m> and that <m>0 \lt u \lt z</m>,
            leading to a contradiction.
