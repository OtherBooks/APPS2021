  <title>Least Upper Bounds</title>
  <p>
    Note that a nonempty set which is bounded above will have many upper bounds:
    if <m>M</m> is an upper bound for a set <m>A</m>,
    so is every <m>t\geq M</m>.
    It is often useful to know what is the best or
    <term>least</term> upper bound for a set.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given a nonempty set <m>A\subseteq \mathbb{R}</m>,
        a number <m>L</m> is a <term>least upper bound</term>
        (LUB) or <term>supremum</term> for <m>A</m> if
        <ol label="labelalph">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>L</m> is an upper bound for <m>A</m>, that is,
              <m>x\leq L</m> for all <m>x\in A</m>, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for all <m>t\lt L</m>, <m>t</m> is not an upper bound,
              that is, there is <m>x\in A</m> so that <m>x>t</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, we say <m>L</m> is a
        <term>greatest lower bound</term>
        (GLB) or <term>infimum</term> for <m>A</m> if
        <ol label="labelalph">
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>L</m> is a lower bound for <m>A</m>, that is,
              <m>x\geq L</m> for all <m>x\in A</m>, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              for all <m>t>L</m>, <m>t</m> is not a lower bound,
              that is, there is <m>x\in A</m> so that <m>x\lt t</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        If an LUB exists for a set <m>A</m>,
        we denote it by <m>\LUB(A)</m>.
        Similarly, we denote a GLB for <m>A</m> by <m>\GLB(A)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In other words,
    <m>L</m> is a least upper bound for a set <m>A</m> if and only if it is the mimimum of all upper bounds for <m>A</m>.
    This allows us to speak of <term>the</term>
    LUB of a set rather than <term>an</term>
    LUB. When proving that a number is the LUB for some set,
    we follow a two-step process of verifying conditions (a) and (b) in the definition.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the set <m>[0,1)</m>.
        The least upper bound is <m>1</m> since (a) <m>1</m> is clearly an upper bound for the set by the definition of <m>[0,1)</m> and (b) if <m>t\lt 1</m>,
        then <m>t</m> is not an upper bound,
        since we can find <m>x\in [0,1)</m> bigger than <m>t</m>:
        if <m>t\lt 0</m>, we can just take <m>x=0</m>;
        otherwise, if <m>0\leq t\lt 1</m>,
        then <m>\frac{1+t}{2}\in [0,1)</m> is larger than <m>t</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S=\{x\in\mathbb{Q} \; | \; x\lt 0\}</m>.
        We claim that <m>\LUB(S)=0</m>.
        <ol label="labelalph">
          <li>
            <p>
              Since every <m>x\in S</m> is negative by definition,
              <m>0</m> is an upper bound.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>t\lt 0</m>, we need to show <m>t</m> is not an upper bound.
              Recall from Week 1 that every interval contains a rational,
              so in particular,
              the interval <m>(t,0)</m> contains a rational <m>r</m>,
              and since <m>r\lt 0</m>, we know <m>r\in S</m>.
              Since <m>r>t</m>, <m>t</m> is not an upper bound for <m>S</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A=\{\frac{1}{n} \; | \; n\in\mathbb{N}\}</m>,
        we claim that <m>\GLB(A)=0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, we verify the two conditions of being a GLB:
        <ol label="labelalph">
          <li>
            <p>
              Since <m>\frac{1}{n}>0</m> for all <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m>,
              <m>0</m> is clearly a lower bound for <m>A</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Next, we need to show each <m>t>0</m> is not a lower bound, that is,
              that there is <m>\frac{1}{n} \in A</m> with <m>\frac{1}{n}\lt t</m>.
              Let <m>t>0</m>.
              By the Archimedean property,
              we can find <m>n\in\mathbb{N}</m> so that <m>n>\frac{1}{t}</m>,
              and so <m>\frac{1}{n}\lt t</m>.
              Since <m>\frac{1}{n}\in A</m>,
              this proves <m>t</m> is not a lower bound.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    Given that a maximum or minimum of a set need not exist,
    why should the least upper bound
    (which is just the minimum of all upper bounds)
    exist at all?
    It turns out that this is an important axiom for the real numbers which we shall need to assume,
    and it cannot be derived from any of the axioms we have assumed so far: \begin{tcolorbox} {
    <em>Completeness Axiom for the real numbers:</em>
    Every nonempty subset of <m>\mathbb{R}</m> which is bounded above has a least upper bound. } \end{tcolorbox}
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Why does the completeness axiom imply that every nonempty subset of
        <m>\mathbb{R}</m> which is bounded below has a GLB?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        See Exercise 5.3 (c) below.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    An important consequence of the Completeness Axiom is the existence of <m>n</m>'th roots of positive real numbers as described in Proposition 2.7.
    We will establish this as Theorem 6.5.
    Another very important consequence of the Completeness Axiom for the real numbers is the Archimedean property which we mentioned earlier.
    We will visit this implication later.
    For now you should feel free to use the Archimedean property in the exercises below.
