  <title>The integers and the Archimedean Property</title>
  <p>
    An important subset of the reals is the <term>integers </term>
    <me>
      \mathbb{Z}=\{...-2,-1,0,1,2,...\}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also let <m>\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3...\}</m> denote the
    <term>positive integers</term>
    or <term>natural numbers</term><fn>
    Some courses assume <m>\mathbb{N}</m> also contains <m>0</m>.
    It's best to clarify this with the instructor if you aren't sure.
    </fn>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that the set <m>\mathbb{N}</m> has the properties that <m>1 \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
    and that if <m>x \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
    then also <m>x+1 \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
    <term>Moreover,
    <m>\mathbb{N}</m> is the smallest subset of the reals which has these two properties.</term>
    It is this observation which makes mathematical induction such a powerful tool for proving statements about the natural numbers <mdash/> the natural numbers and mathematical induction are inextricably bound up together.
    We shall examine induction more carefully below in Section 4.
  </p>
  <p>
    An important result about the reals and integers is the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <title>Archimedean property:</title>
        <p>
          For every <m>x, y \in \mathbb{R}</m> with <m>x,y>0</m>,
          there is an integer <m>n\in \mathbb{N}</m> so that <m>ny>x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This might seem like it should be obvious,
    but how would you prove it?
    Consider just finding an integer <m>n>x</m>.
    If <m>x</m> was an integer, we could simply let <m>n=x+1</m>,
    but if <m>x</m> is not an integer what would we do?
    You might think
    <q>round up to the nearest integer,</q>
    but that this number exists <term>is</term>
    what we are trying to show!
    <term>Why not look at the decimal expansion
    <m>x=a_{0}.a_{1}..</m>. and let <m>n=a_0+1</m>?</term> Firstly,
    we haven't proven that decimal expansions even exist for any real number yet
    (we will in a few weeks),
    and second, the proof that each number has a decimal expansion <term>requires</term>
    the Archimedean property.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a couple of weeks' time, we will prove the Archimedean property,
    as a consequence of the completeness axiom for the real numbers,
    which we shall study in Section 5.<fn>
    It is perhaps disconcerting that it's <term>not</term>
    possible to prove the Archimedean property only using the rules (A0-A4) and (M0-M5),
    together with (R1-R5) which are introduced in Section 3.
    Indeed, it can be established that,
    in the terminology of Section 3, there are ordered fields which do not satisfy the Archimedean property.
    It is precisely because of pitfalls such as this that we are adopting a careful axiomatic perspective for the real numbers.
